This is a small guide on how to develop a generic new feature for
kMap.py. Obviously, this guide is not and can not be extensive, but it
is intended to give a rough overview on some underling design and code
principles used to develop most features currently present.

It is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding of object-
orientated programming, Qt (PyQt) and python.
