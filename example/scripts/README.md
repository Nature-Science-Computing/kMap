# example scripts for kMap
All example and demo scripts in this folder can be excecutee from the command line, e.g.

> python example0.py

## example0.py
This script computes kmaps of pentacene's HOMO for various kinetic energies and
produces a graph with momentum maps for E_kin = 10, 20, 30, 50, 75 and 100 eV.
